## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Bachelor's thesis, which focuses on the automatic extraction of product attributes from images listed by sellers on an e-commerce platform.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Artificial Intelligence Foundations and Blockchain.
  
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to data analysis, product data insights, AI-driven product analysis, and computer vision for e-commerce. I’m also interested in projects where I can apply data analytics techniques to extract valuable business insights.
